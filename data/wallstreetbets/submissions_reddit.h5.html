      <td>Hello fellow autistic children. I know GME is still the hottest thing around. But, I am here to present a smart play, short and long term.\n\nDesktop Metal (DM) DD\n\nDM is a pure play manufacturing company that develops metal 3d printers. They are looking to replace metal casting and metal injection molding in the next 5 - 10 years. I believe that it could become a major player in the advanced manufacturing revolution and have 10x valuation.\n\nThe share price right now is around $25. I am expecting it to go to at least $30 in the very near future and this can easily go to $100 in 2-3 years.\n\nPros :\n\n1. Stellar team: The team consist of professors from MIT, engineers from google,  Stratasys and the likes.\n\n2. Clients: All major automotive OEMs such as General Motors, Ford, Nissan as well as Electronics manufacturers such as SBD are their client.\n\n3. They just launched a new manufacturing system today. The new printer eliminated the solvent debind process which will decrease the cost and time of manufacturing.\n\n4. Earnings are coming up on 11th Feb.\n\n5. The average price target is around $26. The high is $30. The buy rating is around 70% with 0% sell rating.\n\n6. It has a 25% short interest. There are around 15000 $25 calls expiring on 19th Feb. The short sellers are trying to keep the price of the stock below $25. Notice that today the price jumped on the news of the new printer but fell immediately afterwards.\n\n7. Chamath did a PIPE investment in this.\n\n8. It's 10th on the PRNT etf by Cathie Woods.\n\n9. They just bought a dental 3d printing company which is a leader in their field. They have enough cash reserve to buy competitors and increase their revenue streams.\n\nCons :\n\n1. The company is still pre revenue. Earliest revenue would be by 2022 probably.\n\n2. Huge competition from players such as 3ds, Stratasys, Formlabs etc\n\n(More cons are welcome)\n\nMy positions:\n\n100 shares at $21.35\n\n7 calls for $40 05/21\n9 calls for $35 05/21\n1 call for $20 05/21\n\nDue to all the positive sentiment around, this should easily run upto atleast $30 before the earnings. It has already touched $28 last week. Also, for the Technical analysis geeks, this has formed a nice cup and handle shape and should be ready to rocket!\n\nBuying May or further call should make 75-100% profit in the short term. Should hold shares for the long term.\n\nPS: This is not an investment advice. I am a Mechanical Engineer and I love 3d printing and hence I have invested in this stock. Please do your personal DD.\n\nEdit: \n\nhttps://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-stocks-fit-cathie-woods-173506543.html</td>

      <td>TL;DR: Read the fucking post. This is more therapeutic for my own disappointment than it is me trying to "teach" you guys the most important lesson.\n\n##I fucked up today \n\nand it cost me $7k that I will most likely be realizing all or most tomorrow.  I set a long term PT on GME of $40-60 because I want to see a $10bn GameStop in the next year or so and instead I got excited and emotional and jumped in around the $129 mark this afternoon thinking "tHe SqOzEnInG".\n\n[Here's](https://i.imgur.com/TtTEksS.jpg) my screw-up because I got emotional and didn't wait patiently to see if the "upward" trend this afternoon had firm footing. Spoiler alert: it did not. I was only up by about $2k when the floor fell out from under me.\n\nI am EXTREMELY LUCKY because I've been trading all the way up and managed to sell quite a lot of $19dca shares at $380 and throw those profits into my savings account, but I left $25k (about 25% of my gains) in my investment account to "play around" with.\n\nMy CPA said not to, and I thought I could outsmart him. Ideally tomorrow won't be straight red, and I can escape with $17k or more (hopefully) but this should teach you that:\n\n##SOMETIMES YOU MAKE A SHIT TRADE. \n\nThat's why you're supposed to play with money that you can UNEMOTIONALLY LOSE. Seriously guys, it's giving me secondhand panic to see the guys who threw their savings in at $300 and watching the value sink very steadily down to $80 (and possibly less) and then they justify it with "buuuuut it's to show the 1% how powerful I am!" They're still billionaires and you're getting evicted. You really showed them.\n\n##Going forward? I'll write this $7k against my gains and maybe toss the remaining $17k into the SPY or something boomerish while I wait to file my taxes next year OR I'll drop the position to 100 shares realizing about $3,000 in losses and sell weekly covered calls to *hopefully* chase the decreasing share price until I feel comfortable holding very long term or get assigned above my DCA.\n\nInb4 "MELVIN BOT!!!!!!!!!!!!"</td>

      <td>I know we're all autistic retards here but some are truly more retarded than others.\n\nPlenty of people think they know something when they actually don't even know enough to realize that they don't know shit, and that makes you actually retarded.\n\nFor the love of god, if you don't have a link to evidence, or otherwise can't confirm your assertion, don't fucking post it. I do not want to hear that RC buying his allowed 7% (or w/e that post was) will trigger the short squeeze, that shit will not happen and is just a wild autistic gay retard conspiracy theory that's giving people expectations that won't be met, further decreasing their resolve when it inevitably doesn't happen. Maybe there will be the MOASS, maybe there won't. But posting stupid conjecture without evidence or, jesus fucking christ, common sense - is not helping anyone.\n\nIf you want to post your confirmation bias bullshit, instead, don't. This applies to all discussions here, no matter what stock.\n\nThis is not financial advice, this is me telling a bunch of retards to stop humping a doorknob.</td>

      <td>Brand Awareness - Aphria Brands on SweetWater Brews\n\nSweetWater Brewing Company is a craft brewery founded in 1997 by Freddy Bensch and Kevin McNerney in Atlanta, Georgia. SweetWater's beers are unpasteurized and distribution is limited to select states\n\nSweetWater recently annouced that their beer will [be available in 27 states with Western Expansion](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210121005247/en/SweetWater-Brewing-Company-Reaches-New-Heights-Launching-Statewide-in-Colorado-February-1)\n\n&gt;SweetWater‚Äôs expansion into the first U.S. state to legalize recreational marijuana comes shortly after its [November 2020 acquisition](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/aphria-inc-announces-strategic-entry-into-the-united-states-with-an-agreement-to-acquire-sweetwater-brewing-company-301166616.html) by Aphria Inc\n\nIrwin simon, the CEO of Aphria, has a track record for aggressive expansion. He brings a unique background who specializes in M&amp;As. Aphria‚Äôs recent acquisition of SweetWater was a strategic play to expand into US &amp; more importantly, creating brand awareness. \n\n&gt;We will establish and grow our U.S. presence through SweetWater's robust, profitable platform of craft brewing innovation, manufacturing, marketing and distribution expertise. At the same time, we will build brand awareness for our adult-use cannabis brands, Broken Coast, Good Supply, Riff and Solei, through our participation in the growing $29 billion craft brew market in the U.S. ahead of potential future state or federal cannabis legalization\n\n**US Trademarks**\n\nAphria proactively filed US Trademarks for a number of their brands:\n\n[Broken Coast](https://uspto.report/TM/90383411)\n\n[Riff](https://uspto.report/TM/90383302)  \n\n[Solei](https://uspto.report/TM/90383374)\n\nIrwin is leveraging SweetWater's existing infrastructure to accelerate Aphria's entry into the U.S. ahead of federal legalization of cannabis to fuel sustainable profitable growth\n\nI recently made a post in regards to [The Rolling 20‚Äôs - LEAPs on Cannabis](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lab9sk/the_rolling_20s_leaps_on_cannabis/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf) where I highlight long term opportunities the marijuana industry presents with US legalization on the horizon. This is happeneing at an extreme rate &amp; Aphria will be positioning itself as a top tier brand in the US through SweetWater.\n\n[Proof of Concept](https://aphriainc.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Aphria-Inc.-November-2020-AGM-Presentation-FINAL.pdf)\n\n**Broken Coast Brew** - *The best of the bud in the best of the brews*\n&gt;Inspired by the one and only Broken Coast, these small batch craft brews will have you saying ‚Äúwoah‚Äù. Packed with incredible earthy, dank and complex cannabis-inspired flavours you‚Äôll feel the sea breeze in no-time. (Pg.25)\n\n**RIFF** ‚Äì *Loud without the cloud*\n&gt;Not for the un-inspired, RIFF‚Äôs brew masters bring the house down. Hoppy, flavorful and aromatic our lineup brings the party to wherever you are. Join us in this joint effort and run the show with these flavour-packed brews. (Pg.26)\n\n**Solei Hard Seltzer** ‚Äì *it is always sunny with Solei*\n&gt;There is no time to enjoy the sunshine like every time. Solei‚Äôs hard seltzers are created with the perfect combination of freshness and crisp flavours. Made with sun-kissed fruits, Solei Hard Seltzer brings the sun all year round. (Pg.27)\n\nI wouldn‚Äôt be surprised to see the Solei concept featured on SweetWaters newly released [Premium Hard Seltzer](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210125005211/en/SweetWater-Releases-Oasis%C2%AE-Premium-Hard-Seltzer) at some point.\n\nIn addition to its traditional distribution footprint, SweetWater 420 Extra Pale Ale and IPA are served on all Delta flights nationwide plus internationally totaling more than 50 countries across six continents which has served to extend SweetWater's brand reach on both a national and international level. The Company also hosts an annual music festival, "SweetWater 420 Fest," that has evolved into one of the largest and most anticipated music festivals in the U.S., increasing brand awareness nationwide.\n\nThis move creates a branded cannabis lifestyle Products Company with a diverse revenue base. I strongly encourage everyone to look into the management on both sides and come to your own conclusions. I also made a post about about the Aphria/Tilray merger, feel free to check it out:\n\n[Aphria/Tilray - LEAPs on European Cannabis](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lavga2/aphriatilray_leaps_on_european_cannabis/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf)\n\nStay safe &amp; GLTA!\n\n*I am not a Financial Advisor, so please do your own DD. In my opinion, Aphria poised for significant growth*</td>

      <td>Alright retards I think there are some questions that need to be answered as far as GME goes. All that seems to become popular these past few days are diamond hand, ü¶ç together strong means GME will go to the moon. \n\nLook I love the memes as much as the next autist, but it seems as this is the only content in the sub right now. That and the repetitive DD about short interest still being high, short ladder attacks, and lies in the media.\n\nI know this is starting to sound negative, but I‚Äôm not a üè≥Ô∏è‚Äçüåàüêª and believe in the OG GME DD, and am still holding my shares bought at $30, $140, and $240 levels, and I‚Äôm not fucking sellingüíéüëê.\n\nWith that being said though I still have some questions about the future of GME and hope these questions might bring a bigger picture to rest of the sub. I‚Äôll just list the questions below, looking forward to some answers.\n\n1. What more can hedge funds do to drive down the price? We‚Äôve seen the short latter attacks, lies in the media, bots in our own sub. These institutions aren‚Äôt going to back down and have the capital and capability to manipulate the market. So what else can we except going forward from these bastards?\n\n2. Do retail investors have enough power against the hedge funds to come out on top? I‚Äôve seen figures where retail own about 30% of GME, (please correct me if I‚Äôm wrong) but say that all 30% held is that enough to trigger the squeeze?\n\n3. What is it like from the hedgies POV? They‚Äôre obviously trying to trigger selling to help their short position, but what exactly does their short position look like? I am not well-versed and short positions but know the basics. So they‚Äôve borrowed shares that they eventually have buy back. What is the timeline on this? What is their penalty for delaying buying back the shares?\n\n4. What exactly is happening with the brokerages and how much longer will this continue? Should have done more research on this, saw something about clearing houses, but can‚Äôt read too good. Why is RobinHood limiting orders? Is it due to hedge fund pressure or something else? Luckily I have been on TD and haven‚Äôt had problems, but majority of retail/WSB is on RH and these restrictions are hurting GME. What‚Äôs going to happen going forward with RH?\n\n5. Realistically is the SEC going to do anything about the market manipulation, with either Hedge Funds or Brokerages? If so how will it help GME?\n\nThat‚Äôs all I got for now. I‚Äôll update if I think of anything else. I apologize if these questions aren‚Äôt relevant, have already been answered or are just plain stupid. I am a truly a retard. \n\nWould love for other people to comment any questions they have as well, so we can get a bigger picture of GME going forward.</td>

So now everyone is getting on the GME bandwagon because that‚Äôs how DFV made his money right? Yes, he did invest in GME but he did it by buying LEAPS. \n\nIf you don‚Äôt know what LEAPS are they are options a year or more out. DFV bought low priced leaps and it paid off big time.  The thing is, in the last year, anyone could have basically invested in anything  and made a profit. \n\nThe second thing he did was go big. Investing $100 isn‚Äôt going to change your life appreciably except in the most improbable circumstances. Risk what you can, but be willing to lose it all. \n\n\nTL;DR, buy leaps and go big\n\nüöÄüöÄüöÄ</td>

      <td>Yes, this is a casino. Yes, the glories of WSB have been built on the charred corpses of untold retards who diamond-handed weeklies until the bitter end, and the few who climbed atop the fray to reach Valhalla. But there's an inconvenient reality that calls into question the mythology of WSB, which is that many of our most storied figures are, beyond the memes and rocket emojis, investors, rather than gamblers or their slightly more couth bretheren, traders.\n\nIf there's one thing that I hope the flock of newly-minted degenerates realizes, however recent events have shaken out, it's that there are multiple paths here and multiple ways to get rich and go broke or some horrific combination thereof. After GME or (insert stock here) comes and goes, there will be other plays that speak to your fancy. But the more you know about yourself and how you'd like to play this very elaborate game, the less likely you are to get fucked by it.\n\nHopping onto meme stocks is just one path. It's the most accessible and I'm all for it. Entire currencies have been created based solely on meme power. But the essential thing to know is that history does not repeat itself. There will never be another TSLA or another GME. When you invest in a meme, you aren't investing in something bound by history, or reason. Many of the stocks that become memes actually begin, like GME, as solid value propositions. By the time they become memes, though, you've already missed the "value" phase and you're basically banking on something that's hard to pin down.\n\nIt's a slippery basis for an investment, but it's made a lot of people rich. Maybe it will make you rich. This is one path that you can choose, but here's the thing, you actually have to be committed to it. Hopscotching from one meme to another won't get you to tendie town. That's trading, not investing, and trading doesn't work out well for most people.\n\nThe unique thing about GME - and many will disagree - is that it's a meme based on a trade rather than an investment. If you're an investor, a short squeeze is meaningless. Ryan Cohen can't sell at the peak. I think it's all gotten fantastically muddled. People have piled onto this play which is essentially a trade, but they aren't approaching it like traders. Again, trading is hard. If you're like me, then you suck at it and have had to swear it off after blowing up your portfolio twice on stupid options plays. Traders - the ones far more sophisticated than you and me - have actually been making a killing on GME.\n\nI'd argue that the GME team does consist of investors, but they're investing in the wrong thing. At the end of the day, you can only invest in a company, and not a community of investors. Investing will never become a "movement" because movements are about values, while the market is about money. In this game, money always wins. You can attach a face to it - Melvin Capital, Citadel, whatever - but it is inherently faceless.\n\nDFV didn't initially invest in a meme, or a movement - he invested in a (deep fucking) value proposition informed by his analysis of where Gamestop stood as a company and where it was heading. And then, as we all know, he held. And that's exactly what he has in common with WSB's other luminaries.\n\nIf you can see what the market doesn't yet see, put a chunk on the line that you can afford to lose, and *wait* (that's the important part) then you might have some juicy gain porn of your own to post in a year or two. You need conviction, though, or you'll just spend all your time looking at the tickers that made it big that day and move on to the next, sexier play. The only way to have conviction is to learn enough that you can actually internalize the DD that you come across and make it your own. And usually the only way to learn is to fail. Maybe that's the part of the road you're on right now, but it's a good start.\n\nEdited for TL;DR - Know the difference between trading and investing, and try to do more of the latter.</td>

      <td>I read through the posts here and see so much confusion, chaos, and fear, especially after a day like today where people see losses. People need to understand the GME saga is not united in its ideology. You need to adapt your expectations to that key fundamental fact. There are many factions of "investors" here. This was the case from the beginning, and has amplified as time went on and public exposure to the stock grew. People have their own agendas and plans, their own unique circumstances. This innate disunity is what is being used against you.  The billion dollar hedge funds know your lack of cohesion can be exploited, and that is exactly what they are doing. It is actually their only option. What else can they do? Admit defeat, close their doors forever and swallow untold tens of billions more in losses to cover their still numerous outstanding shorts? No, they are going to keep kicking the can down the road as long as they can, hoping to break your chokehold on them by exploiting your factions. They do this with lying, cheating, market manipulation and much more. But their main play to break the squeeze is the same: they need you to scatter and sell. Why did the VW squeeze of 2008 work so well? Because one single company (Porsche) bought up all the stock and one person was making all the decisions about holding and selling. In that case, the hedge funds were the ones caught off-guard,  scrambling in disarray to compete with each other and grab up all the shares they could. Right now, those same hedge funds are acting in collaboration and we, the retail investors are the ones in disarray. \n\nThere are people who bought GME to make money. Everybody loves money right? That's probably why most people bought it. But there are also a lot of people who bought GME as a form of protest and revenge against the criminal class of Wall Street. There are people who love the company Gamestop and envision a brilliant future for it. Some people took personal offense to shorts coming in and trying to break down a store they like. Some people just really like the stock. Maybe people bought it for all of the above and much more.  No matter the reason, if you want to win, you will need to find common ground and learn to work together if you want to see the line go up and force those cornered hedge fund shorts to pay up. You have been given a golden opportunity to squeeze billions out of these Wall Street funds. It is very unlikely an event like this will happen again, at least not for a very long time. \n\nWhat I saw this morning was a predictable product of our innate disunity. Due to the viral exposure of WSB and the GME frenzy many new investors moved in last week in a very short amount of time. This created a "hype" bubble, which is actually fairly common in the stock market and happens all the time. This brought in all sorts of novice and first time stock owners, especially ones who don't understand basic stock market mechanics like price, volume, and order books. (Please people, learn that price does not mean much without VOLUME) They came in hoping to make a quick buck. They bought in at a higher price last week, saw the price per share tumble Friday, fell for all the fake news, rumors and distractions over the weekend because they don't understand that hedge funds lie for a business, saw the share price tumble today without understanding why, then panicked. They sold, dropping the price further, which panicked other investors of the same mindset, they sold, and so on until stop losses were triggered and caused more sales which panicked further people who sold and so on. This has been a strategy of the hedge funds since day one of taking money from the dumb retail market. It is just particularly effective when there is a bubble in stock price. This is actually an argument many people use as a justification of shorts, as they keep the entire market rational and prevent a bubble from ever forming so big that it has catastrophic economic consequences. But that is neither here nor there. But the point is people are confusing two separate events, this rapid bubble that formed last week and popped some steam off today, and the squeeze which has been a steady and gradual process. Remember, GME was $4 just 6 months ago. What was the low price today, with the stock price manipulation and panic selling here? Somewhere around $80?  Which is right about where the price was last week Monday just before it went absolutely viral. \n\nGME is still heavily overshorted. The Bloomberg terminal screenshot posted in another post here shows 90% as of today, 2/2/21. We are still in a squeeze. Yes, we had a temporary bubble and setback from our climb up, but no, this is not over by any stretch of the imagination. If you want to see the share price keep climbing then HOLD. If you want to see Wall Street bleed, choke on their arrogance and hubris, then HOLD. If you want to make Gamestop the funniest meme in all of stock market history, HOLD!!!! Feeding the hedge funds back shares at a lower price takes the pressure off them and lets them cover while mitigating their losses. Don't feed the hedge funds. We have the upperhand. We have the power and leverage. Only we can give it up and squander it away. They are the ones bleeding millions in interest. They are the ones with furious shareholders and wealth investors breathing down their necks. It costs us nothing but the own stress we give ourselves to hold. I agree we are up against a rigged system. We should all be calling and emailing our congress representatives to demand investigations into why so many brokers shut out new buyers but not sellers starting Thursday. We should be demanding investigations into institutional shorters who are manipulating the stock price purposefully by pingponging shares back and forth to each other with lower and lower prices supplemented with coordinated large dumps. We should be demanding investigations into what the financial relationships are, if any, between certain brokers who froze out buyers and these institutions with massive shorts on GME that we are betting against. We should be demanding adherence to SEC rules regarding transparent short positions. There is a lot to fix and change. So let's try to stay united on the things we can all agree on, like making the market fair for the little guy. Let's stay united in our vigilance against deceit and misinformation spread by these shorters. Let's stay united in our conviction to HOLD!!!!!!!!!!!!!! No amount of short ladder attacks, price manipulation, rumors, or fake news can scare us holders into selling. Why? Because we are ideologically united. The money will follow, if you hold. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is not financial advice and I am not a professional. I hold GME, 42 shares @ average of $138</td>
