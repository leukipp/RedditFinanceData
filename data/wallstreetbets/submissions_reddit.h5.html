      <td>**What is Different about, The Big Squeeze.**\n\nI'm always willing to lose the money when Trading, thats the common denominator. But look at the upside. If this popped and I sold? **God damn, thats what I cant afford to lose**. I would never forgive myself.\n\nI can pass up other trades, but TBH **reverse FOMO** in a big way. There is no way in HELL I am missing out on this.\n\nWhat other trade can you be apart of with these stakes? Even if we lose the money, IT WILL BE THE BEST MONEY I EVER LOST.\n\n**Why it is different.**\n\nI remember a bunch of us on this sub saw the Coronavirus dip coming, It was called the beer virus and yeah, its never popular to be a üåàüêª... Guess what? We made a lot of money. Guess who I told.... NO ONE.\n\nWe saw one of the most impactful tsunamis to hit the financial system, It wasn't cool to be right. It wasn't another BIG SHORT.\n\nYou will have a lifetime to make and lose money in the market, but this is a once in a lifetime opportunity and I support it win or loose. üíéüñêüñê\n\nPosition: 26 shares. Contracts expired worthless Friday cause "VLAD the STOCK IMPALER\*"\*\n\nTLDR: There is no way in hell I am missing out on this. If we're wrong, we loose money. If were right we **make history** (Even more than it already has)  \*Not investment advice, my opinion\* \*Only invest what you can afford to lose\*</td>

      <td>Throwing out some lessons-learned for everyone (especially the 6.2 million people who joined in the past two weeks).  Here's why shit went sideways for you:\n\n**You didn't do your research:** GME (and to a lesser extent NOK/BBBY/BB) has been a work-in-progress for months.  This wasn't something organic and spontaneous; there was a very small window to catch the lightning.  Once in, you took the advice from random internet strangers who want you to buy/hold to increase the value of their positions.\n\n**You FOMO'd:** If you knew about this before $100 and didn't jump, you probably should've sat it out.  If you found out about this after $100, you should have watched from the sidelines and taken notes for the next time.\n\n**You didn't have a plan:** Sure, your spaceship emojis are cute but they're free and you can't buy anything with them in the real world.  If you're buying stocks, you're doing so with the intent to make money.  Money is only real when you sell.  Set a goal, stick to it (or make small adjustments; it's ok to change a goal as long as it's REASONABLE).  This includes taking profits and then, if you want, buying back in on a dip.\n\n**You made it personal:** Stocks aren't your pets; they're fucking cattle.  Get what you can out of them and then move on.  You don't buy stocks to join a feel-good movement about sticking it to the &lt;insert target group here&gt; or because "I like to company/stock", you buy them to make money. \n\n**You made it a group activity:** Unless you're pooling resources and winnings, all these "Ape" comments are fucking retarded.  That's code for, "please don't leave me I don't want to be the last one holding bags"\n\n**You missed the obvious signs:** WSB goes dark and all the meme stocks collapse a the same time, that's a sign.  All of the meme stocks move in-sync, that's a sign (algos are in charge, not retail investors).\n\n**You used money you couldn't lose:** This ties into the group mentality and DD where you just hopped on the bus without asking where it was going or how; NEVER spend money you can't afford to lose in the stock market -- there are no sure bets.\n\n100% this will get removed by all the fucking idiots in this sub so do yourself a solid and copy/paste it for reference; hopefully it'll add value to your future endeavors.\n\nIf you made money in all of this, congrats; don't forget to put some aside for taxes.</td>

      <td>First things first, I am not Melvin Capital and I am not trying to distract you from GME squeeze. I am just a retard on this sub who's seen lots of quality DD's and would like to summarize all of it into one solid long DD. \n\nBefore I get started with the DD, I wanna make put it out there that **"THIS IS NOT A FINANCIAL ADVICE NOR I AM SAYING YOU SHOULD BUY THIS STOCK, DO YOUR OWN RESEARCH YOU DINGUS"** \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCorsair IPO'ed in September at $17.00 and the stock went rocket rocket straight upto 30$+. The all time highs has been 50$ ish and is currently trading at 38$. They absolutely destroyed Q3 earnings and beat expectations in every department.   \n\n\n**Here's some of the highlights of their Q3 earnings, Source :- globenewswire &amp; their Q3 report.**\n\nNet revenue was $457.1 million, an increase of 60.7% year-over-year. Segment net revenue was $161.6 million, an increase of 128.8% year-over-year. Gaming components and systems segment net revenue was $295.5 million, an increase of 38.3% year-over-year.\n\nGross profit was $127.9 million, an increase of 112.4% year-over-year, with gross margin of 28.0%, an improvement of 680 basis points year-over-year.\n\nOperating income was $49.7 million, an increase of 353.6% year-over-year.\n\nAdjusted operating income was $61.4 million, an increase of 193.7% year-over-year.\n\nNet income was $36.4 million, or $0.40 per diluted share, compared to net income of $1.5 million in the same period a year ago, or $0.02 per diluted share.\n\nAdjusted net income was $48.5 million, or $0.54 per diluted share, an increase of 384.0% year-over-year compared to adjusted net income of $10.0 million, or $0.13 per diluted share.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA was $63.7 million, an increase of 184.9% year-over-year, with adjusted EBITDA margin of 13.9%, an improvement of 610 basis points year-over-year.\n\nAs of September 30, 2020, we had cash and restricted cash of $120.1 million, $48.0 million capacity under our revolving credit facility and total long-term debt of $370.1 million.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**SNAPSHOT of their Financials**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hw5nm9oc85f61.png?width=2708&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9171b046f885cd30f1efedc6bdf3caef09525ddb\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7izsj9kd85f61.png?width=2880&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8aadc9aff929a9efaa409c43240f6db8ba075d21\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe stock ran from 21$ to 40$ after their Q3 earnings report so there should be no brainer that stock won't do the same again. **Like I already mentioned, that anything discussed on this DD is not an advice and its a personal opinion.**\n\n$CRSR had a non-dilutive offering last week at $35 per share. This didn't add shares, just gave their initial PE firm a chance to cash out. With 7M shares sold at $35, this built a solid new "floor" for the stock on high volume at $35. Corsair has 36% short interest (obviously lower than GME), but the main IPO lock up period doesn't expire til March. Corsair's current available float is only 20% of total shares outstanding while short interest is 36%. Not a lot of shares available for shorts to cover if the stock starts moving against them.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe Market Cap for this stock is \~3.31 B and their Revenue for Q4 is half of that? Insane. I'm likely expecting it to be way over the estimations above just like when they doubled expectations the quarter before. The floor for this is 35$ as shown by the past month and a half and It peaked at 51$.\n\nu/thechosenguy1 said "These numbers aren't going to drop either after COVID. When you invest this much money into a gaming setup for you or your child or whatever. They will keep putting money in. When their mouse breaks from smashing it after losing an online game like the baby they are. Or perhaps after they spill their Mountain Dew all over their mousepad? A lot of things that this pandemic has made us accustomed to are here to stay." **üöÄ üöÄ üöÄ**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**TLDR : I am holding 40$c's expiring 2/19. THIS IS NOT A FINANCIAL ADVICE . DO YOUR OWN RESEARCH.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Thanks to these users for posting the DD's. I have used some of their information into my DD.**\n\nu/Florida_Knight77\n\nu/BarmeIo-Xanthony\n\nu/thechosenguy1</td>

Using imaginary lines on god knows what graphs, like an astrologer doing business. And about more than one stonk. That's the kind of shit we need to bring back.\n\nSo to those who feel inclined to tag your clearly non-DD post as DD, may I direct you to the "Discussion" tag?</td>

Huge growth, recent acquisition, fair value estimate showing ~50% upside, earnings in 2 weeks at which point the fair value will likely increase even further as the recurring revenues from acquisitions and the continued growth push the data averages higher. \n\n**Positions**\nCall volume for March-May expirys have been spiking, so that's where I'm at. Since the fair value is over $12, I'm buying $11 and $12 strikes. \n\n\n**3/19 $11c**\n\n**3/19 $12c**\n\n**5/21 $11c**\n\n**5/21 $12c**</td>

I wasn't even in GME, but I cannot in good conscious support a company that distorts the free market. Yesterday, when the restriction was 1 GME share, I bought at $246 out of spite. Limit set at $10k if they want it back (so they can't loan out the share). Fuck em.\n\nI have been exiting all my positions yesterday and today and have been transferring the funds to TD Ameritade because I like the Think Or Swim platform.\n\nWhat platforms are all y'all moving to?</td>

Check to see how long the accounts been active, and how much Karma they've acquired. If they're sitting below 100 karma, they're probably a bot. However, I ran across a few today that had been spamming free karma subs before coming here. Melvs interns are getting smarter apparently. \nWhy so many bots? What's it all mean? They're scared. They're trying to make you retards panic sell. They want to deprive you of your sweet sweet tendies. If you see a bot, call it out and move on. See you all in the promise land. üíéüôå</td>

Every day they spook is billions back in your pocket, so just hit them with everything you got, carry the fees, put up the margin and wait for them to crumble. \n\nTo put this clearly, 91 million shorted shares, at a loss of $215 per share is $20 billion.

The future is EV for the vehicle industry and motorcycles are no different. A niche market for powerful EV bikes has yet to be untapped and is what will push Harley Davidson into the future.\n\n¬∑ he became CEO of Puma ‚Äì making him the youngest ever CEO of a German company at the time ‚Äì and turned the near-bankrupt business into one of the world's top three sports brands\n\n¬∑ he now sits on the boards of Harley-Davidson, financial services company Cranemere, and the Kenya Wildlife Service, as well as running his own charitable foundation and co-chairing The B Team, a non-profit that he co-founded with Richard Branson in 2012 to promote sustainable business practices.\n\nHis previous ventures gave him a strong backing socially and experience with sustainable energy which is a must for Harley Davidson.\n\nTouring and Large cruisers remain to be the biggest driver in profit and production for the company. Even through COVID-19 these remain steady. Introduction of their new bike, Pan-America Adventure Touring Motorcycle, is much more appealing to the younger crowd.\n\n**ELECTRIC MOTORCYLES:**\n\nHarley-Davidson is striving to be the leader in electric Motorcycles which will quickly set them apart from all other competitors and introduce a new segment of consumers for HOG. The executive staff is fully committed to a distinct product with go-to market strategies.\n\n**BEARISH SENTIMENT:**\n\nBOOMERS RIDE MOTORCYCLES XD\n\n**TL;DR: BUY THE DIP :)**\n\nüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ</td>

      <td>Today was a crazy ride, and we've all been following the action the entire time. My opinion is that unless I can find compelling evidence that the squeeze is truly done for and off the table, my conviction has only grown stronger.\n\nMost important things that stick out, all of which really build a case that must not be dismissed:\n\n1) If shorts have covered, we should have noticed reasonable strong upwards momentum, as buying pressure consists of short covering along with retail buying, and a limited float.\n\n2) Past few days we've seen trading volumes below average, likely suppressed demand caused by broker restrictions on buying. Lower volume can make any dump pull the price down easily. Especially when the demand side is getting locked out. Have to mention the timing of which Robinhood locked buying last week as well, coinciding with a massive dip.\n\n3) Look at [this image](https://preview.redd.it/dralf2uks4f61.png?width=1900&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=52223e916aacb4f65681da1cfe4f5e1ade7cea30)\n\nNotice how AMC &amp; GME have almost identical candlesticks, and the same is in the BB-NOK pair. It is undeniable that a lot of people are buying this stock and holding this stock. Not just in America but all across the world. We have global support.\nYou would think that with this many people in the trade (whether they are on the buying / selling side) we would see greater variance. This correlation to me looks like obvious manipulation by higher frequency and higher volume algorithmic trading.\nIt's hard to look at these charts and say that this is natural supply and demand. Seriously, same candlestick patterns on unrelated stocks. This price action is influenced by targeted manipulation to a high degree. Even if people were really selling off like crazy, wouldn't we see more natural candles?\n\n4) We have mainstream media (MSM) covering the "reddit mania" extensively. MSM says reddit is trying to squeeze silver, which is false. You will not find anyone pushing to buy SLV on reddit. In fact, you will see a warning about silver and how many HFs have long positions in it.\n\n5) We've seen an influx of bots on social media (reddit, FB, twitter) promoting silver, spamming that GME squeeze is finished, diverting attention away from the more uninformed audience. Why? If it's finished why the need for these?\n\n6) MSM says the short squeeze mania is over and shorts have covered. If that is true, why are we seeing trade restrictions still on more and more brokers, and nonstop coverage all over TV and the internet. If it's over, why are there so many articles bashing retail to stay away?\n\n7) GME is an outlier in the "failed-to-deliver" statistic, and has been put on NYSE short restriction (uptick rule) effective tomorrow. Something fishy is going on with the shares in the float.\n\n8) SI% numbers are very conflicting. Especially the numbers that came around 30-50%. It was then later mentioned by someone in S3 that a different calculation was used. If you convert to the old calculation, you still get over 100% SI%. Why are they trying to change it all of a sudden?\n\nTo me, this is enough to say we're still in the game. If it's over, let them prove it by crushing GME to $20 and on February 9th we hear the official SI% being low. Then it's finished. Something tells me that it's not over, and this is all a ploy to mitigate the damage they are about to receive when GME eventually triggers the MOASS.\n\nCan't say for sure it's a 100% trip to the moon and beyond, but what's really suggested otherwise? This whole misinformation campaign + price manipulation combo is too important to dismiss.\n\nRemember I'm retard and please make your own financial decisions.\n\nPosition 50 shares GME $210\n\nüöÄüíéüôå $GME to the moon üöÄüíéüôå</td>

      <td>Listen up, you bukkake fest of screeching mongols. You‚Äôve been thrashing and kicking, like you always do, but in the wrong type of way. What am I talking about?\n\nYou set your sights on the BANG stocks and finally found a way to hit Wall Street where it hurts. A win for the retail investor, one might say.  You were suddenly seeing more green in your portfolios than many of you could have ever hoped for and you were hitting the üåàüêª where it hurts, their pocketbook. \n\nWhere you went wrong was taking that small victory and doing full blown retarded things to celebrate. Things like flying banners over robinhood, buying billboards, and just generally taking focus away from your goals and the path to them. You‚Äôve poked the bear and now the bear has swiped back. \n\nInstead of going full retard, which Robert Downey Jr says you should never do, take these moments away from the market to self-improve. Learn to read, research financial topics, evaluate your past plays and the emotions involved, just do more than screeching at the hedge funds for such a small victory. Think about how you, the individual investor, can continue hitting the shorts and start showing the red on their balance sheets again. Always stay retarded but in the way that benefits you at the end of the day. \n\nNot a word of this is financial advice.</td>
