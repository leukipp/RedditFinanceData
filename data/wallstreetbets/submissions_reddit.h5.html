      <td>Today was a crazy ride, and we've all been following the action the entire time. My opinion is that unless I can find compelling evidence that the squeeze is truly done for and off the table, my conviction has only grown stronger.\n\nMost important things that stick out, all of which really build a case that must not be dismissed:\n\n1) If shorts have covered, we should have noticed reasonable strong upwards momentum, as buying pressure consists of short covering along with retail buying, and a limited float.\n\n2) Past few days we've seen trading volumes below average, likely suppressed demand caused by broker restrictions on buying. Lower volume can make any dump pull the price down easily. Especially when the demand side is getting locked out. Have to mention the timing of which Robinhood locked buying last week as well, coinciding with a massive dip.\n\n3) Look at [this image](https://preview.redd.it/dralf2uks4f61.png?width=1900&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=52223e916aacb4f65681da1cfe4f5e1ade7cea30)\n\nNotice how AMC &amp; GME have almost identical candlesticks, and the same is in the BB-NOK pair. It is undeniable that a lot of people are buying this stock and holding this stock. Not just in America but all across the world. We have global support.\nYou would think that with this many people in the trade (whether they are on the buying / selling side) we would see greater variance. This correlation to me looks like obvious manipulation by higher frequency and higher volume algorithmic trading.\nIt's hard to look at these charts and say that this is natural supply and demand. Seriously, same candlestick patterns on unrelated stocks. This price action is influenced by targeted manipulation to a high degree. Even if people were really selling off like crazy, wouldn't we see more natural candles?\n\n4) We have mainstream media (MSM) covering the "reddit mania" extensively. MSM says reddit is trying to squeeze silver, which is false. You will not find anyone pushing to buy SLV on reddit. In fact, you will see a warning about silver and how many HFs have long positions in it.\n\n5) We've seen an influx of bots on social media (reddit, FB, twitter) promoting silver, spamming that GME squeeze is finished, diverting attention away from the more uninformed audience. Why? If it's finished why the need for these?\n\n6) MSM says the short squeeze mania is over and shorts have covered. If that is true, why are we seeing trade restrictions still on more and more brokers, and nonstop coverage all over TV and the internet. If it's over, why are there so many articles bashing retail to stay away?\n\n7) GME is an outlier in the "failed-to-deliver" statistic, and has been put on NYSE short restriction (uptick rule) effective tomorrow. Something fishy is going on with the shares in the float.\n\n8) SI% numbers are very conflicting. Especially the numbers that came around 30-50%. It was then later mentioned by someone in S3 that a different calculation was used. If you convert to the old calculation, you still get over 100% SI%. Why are they trying to change it all of a sudden?\n\nTo me, this is enough to say we're still in the game. If it's over, let them prove it by crushing GME to $20 and on February 9th we hear the official SI% being low. Then it's finished. Something tells me that it's not over, and this is all a ploy to mitigate the damage they are about to receive when GME eventually triggers the MOASS.\n\nCan't say for sure it's a 100% trip to the moon and beyond, but what's really suggested otherwise? This whole misinformation campaign + price manipulation combo is too important to dismiss.\n\nRemember I'm retard and please make your own financial decisions.\n\nPosition 50 shares GME $210\n\nüöÄüíéüôå $GME to the moon üöÄüíéüôå\n\n**TL;DR** - *YES THERE IS LIKELY TO HAVE BEEN A SQUEEZE LAST WEEK, BUT WHAT WE HAVE BEEN SEEING LATELY SUGGESTS THIS IS NOT OVER! MOASS IS POSSIBLE UNTIL PROVEN OTHERWISE! WAIT FOR ACTUAL CONFIRMATION BEFORE THROWING IN THE TOWEL!*</td>

      <td>Listen up, you bukkake fest of screeching mongols. You‚Äôve been thrashing and kicking, like you always do, but in the wrong type of way. What am I talking about?\n\nYou set your sights on the BANG stocks and finally found a way to hit Wall Street where it hurts. A win for the retail investor, one might say.  You were suddenly seeing more green in your portfolios than many of you could have ever hoped for and you were hitting the üåàüêª where it hurts, their pocketbook. \n\nWhere you went wrong was taking that small victory and doing full blown retarded things to celebrate. Things like flying banners over robinhood, buying billboards, and just generally taking focus away from your goals and the path to them. You‚Äôve poked the bear and now the bear has swiped back. \n\nInstead of going full retard, which Robert Downey Jr says you should never do, take these moments away from the market to self-improve. Learn to read, research financial topics, evaluate your past plays and the emotions involved, just do more than screeching at the hedge funds for such a small victory. Think about how you, the individual investor, can continue hitting the shorts and start showing the red on their balance sheets again. Always stay retarded but in the way that benefits you at the end of the day. \n\nNot a word of this is financial advice.</td>

      <td>We have gained so many new people over the past week, I feel like this needs to be said.\n\nGameStop is falling. Whether the hedge funds covering is legal or not doesn‚Äôt matter. If it‚Äôs done illegally, they‚Äôll get a slap on the wrist, a 1-10mil fine, and chalk it up as a net gain vs what they would have lost.\n\nRobinhood and other brokers rigged the game against us, and that‚Äôs it. They might get a slap on the wrist, maybe some will have to remove certain features, but that‚Äôs it.\n\nThere won‚Äôt be a great retribution. There probably won‚Äôt be ‚Äújustice‚Äù. Sometimes you just lose money. This is the danger of fomo and looking at the market as a get rich quick scheme. MOST people lose when they do this, only a few win, and usually you have to be in early enough to win anything substantial.\n\nSometimes being a retard pays off, but most of the time you just lose. There is almost never some some great conspiracy theory. Almost always it‚Äôs just an L.\n\nGameStop ran up over 1000% in a month. It‚Äôs very likely we‚Äôve already experienced the short squeeze. \n\nAMC issued 50million additional shares at the peak which essentially wiped out all short squeeze potential.\n\nThere is a ton of money to be made with our collective minds, but spending your energy justifying GameStop is not the way to make that money. If you genuinely think that the short sellers are not currently covering their positions at the prices over the past 2 days then you‚Äôre delusional. Take your emotions out of the market and you‚Äôll make a lot more money.\n\nGodspeed, autists.</td>

In the cold nights of January when hedge funds of dubious morale had their asses handed to them by a bunch of apes with bananas and lust for a stonks. Dirty tricks were played by brokers and other establishments of Wall Street as they waged an ongoing struggle against the common man. This story starts as the struggle seemed lost for our brave apes with bananas.......\n\nScrew it. Read it for yourself.

      <td>To those whose home has been invaded, I thank you. I am upset, somewhat sullen, and slightly bitter, but still owe you thanks.\n\nI had some prior investment experience. Nothing too serious. I'm a frugal person who saves a lot. I've passively invested--in the most elementary of ways through a few stocks, Roths and IFs--but never took the dive to properly understand the market, its mechanisms, and its movements.\n\nOver the past few weeks, I've gained some insights on these. But I have come to the full realization of just how little I knew. I've attempted to grasp too much too quickly, and had left myself holding a bag. I fell victim to the hype and prospect of gaining a stronger economic footprint amongst a pandemic-driven job market, and have lost about 15% of my net worth. Thankfully, I gambled money that wasn't necessary for bills or debts. Most of my emergency fund is gone, but that will come back soon enough.\n\nWhat will remain is the cemented, constant caution of DD. The understanding that a core community, whitewashed by popularity, can generate momentum in which they aren't heeded. The reiteration that financial success in these markets is not one of kindness, altruism, or hand-holding.\n\nFor all the gaslighting, satire, and lulz, I hate you. But I also understand; you cannot continue to preach the truth when fanaticism dominates the discussion. I've been on the internet long enough to expect nothing less.\n\nThank you for creating this space. I will take my losses. I will **lurk**, **listen,** and **learn.**\n\nI suggest you  ü¶ç  do the same.</td>

      <td>So, we have got A LOT of shit being flung all over here today and surprisingly you apes ü¶ç have been the least problematic bunch.\n\n**We‚Äôre heard all sorts of talk, many but not all being bots:**\n\n- ‚ÄúThe shorts have covered, it‚Äôs over‚Äù\n\n- ‚ÄúI cashed out but sadly it was during last weeks premarket at 510 and not 515, you guys are retarded and should sell.‚Äù\n\n- ‚ÄúI burned my house down for the insurance money and put it into GME along with my life savings at $450 and now I‚Äôm long rope.‚Äù\n\n- ‚ÄúI sucked 185 dicks for 185 bucks and got 1 GME share today but then I sold because this is taking too long.‚Äù\n\n**So to ease your minds I‚Äôve taken the time to post [This Poll](https://strawpoll.com/crzhh7f7b/r) on WSB and found the median amount of shares owned by the average WSB user**\n\nThe data set ranges are a bit wide but for a median it works just fine and may actually be a bit of an underestimation. \n\nSo, the number of shares the average WSB user owns? **8.** That may not seem like much but let‚Äôs just check out the number of new WSB users in recent times.\n\nI checked [subreddit stats](https://subredditstats.com/r/Wallstreetbets) and saw that on Jan 23rd, we had about **2M** Redditors on WSB, today that number is over **8M**.\n\nNow let‚Äôs be VERY generous and say 30% of the total number of users are actually bots, 10% lurkers, 10% with 0 shares.\n\nWell then that means **4M X 8 Shares = 32M Shares**\n\nü¶ç ü¶ç ü¶ç **is in control of over 50% of the available shares.**\n\nAnd let me make it just a bit more interesting...\n\n**If those 4M holders theoretically bought 4 more shares each, we would own the available float on GameStop, and we could literally set our price with no room to fuck around. We would effectively own GameStop.**\n\n**TL;DR: The average WSB user owns 8 shares, some math shows that‚Äôs about 32M shares out of about 47M Float**\n\nBUY MORE SHARES, LETS FUCK THE INSTITUTIONS WHO HAVE FUCKED YOU OVER AS LONG AS YOU‚ÄôVE BEEN ALIVE.\n\nEdit: This is not financial advice! I just like the stock. Do whatever the fuck you want. I‚Äôm buying more.\n\nEdit: shoutout to my boy Jbreezerfreezer who did the math because I‚Äôm retarded. Also yes, it‚Äôs far from exact maffs.\n\nEdit: Mandatory - 33 shares at 87.56 average\n\nEdit: New math accounting for potential 0 shares.</td>

      <td>I am doing this to lay out some of the facts that I see as the main reason I am still holding.  There is a bull and a bear case in my opinion, seeing that I am still holding I think there is a much stronger bull case though.\n\nBull Case:\n\n\-Another round of stimmy will give us all a boost\n\n\-Short interest as of 2/2 is growing.  [https://fintel.io/ss/us/gme](https://fintel.io/ss/us/gme) 16 Milllion shorted today and a massive Short ratio, and I don't see them covering any time soon.  So the short squeeze story is there.  Also, most of those are a bunch of new paper handed boomer bears from Twitter shorting this, so that's an easy squeeze. As well, since we are now on the short restriction list, that's LITERALLY WHAT HAPPEND TO US.  They cant short, only close positions, similar to us not being able to buy.  (I think that's what that means?)\n\n\-We have diamond hands, and we can remain stupid longer than they can remain solvent.  We have millions of people switching to fidelity and vanguard, and new members joining everyday to join the fight.  Even 1 diamond handed retard doing their part helps.  We gained 6 million people in a month.  If even 1 million of them each bought 1 share, and held.  At 100$ a share, that's alot of money and shares.  IDK math.  (100 Million dollars?).  It helps anyway.  This will ramp up, and just as we had some random paper hands on the way down, they will have paper hands on the way up.\n\n\-We just got a whole bunch more people, at a whole lot cheaper price.  Sure, we have alot of people at 300 and 350, but we have ALOT of people.  Getting all these new people able to reload at 100$ a share is a godsend.  I doubled my shares on the way down, and will probably buy more as money clears.  Diamond hands are the way to go.  IF you are scared, don't want a loss, etc etc. It is literally so simple.  Buy, put in the highest sell order the brokerage will let you, and don't worry about it other than to buy more.  8 MILLION people even with 1000$ each, COULD LITERALLY BUY  GAMESTOP AT ITS CURRENT PRICE.  We already have an edge with people like DFV having .5% of gamestop.  I don't know what his plan is, but if it keeps dropping, and he decides to buy more, or exercise those options, that position will only grow. We have several millionaires in here as well buying and holding.  So, if you have 1-2 shares, they will help make up for it.\n\nBear Case:\n\n\-Honestly, the only way we lose this is if you sell, or people lose confidence. Have a plan, don't doubt, stick to it, chin up, buy more, live life in the mean time.</td>

      <td>Currently holding 25 Shares of GME at about $104 average price. Today shook me, not gonna lie, as a college student it's scary to lose thousands of $$$ in minutes but these hands are diamond!! üôåüèªüíé\n\nAnyway, what is confusing me about all this is the statistics, maybe its because I'm a retarded tendie loving idiot, so maybe someone could explain to me what I'm seeing.\n\nOn Yahoo Finance, It says that the percentage of shares owned by insiders is 27.33% and the percentage of shares held by institutions is 122.04%. How can there be more than 100% of a company? &amp; that's not even including retail investors (or maybe it does, again, I'm retarded) \nOkay, that seems weird but what about this other stuff? like the fact that there are supposed to be a total of 69,000,000 shares outstanding, yet over 61,000,000 shares are shorted? is it really possible for there to be less than 8,000,000 shares that aren't being shorted? and if that was the case wouldn't there be no way for us (retail investors) to bring the price up at all? ü§îü§îü§î\n\nAlso, the short percentage of the float is 226.42% for Gamestop when I did research into the other top shorted stocks, Bed Bath and Beyond was mentioned so I decided to check their statistics versus Gamestop, and their percentage of the float was 82%. \n\nSo i decided to compare the numbers of the Top 5 ‚ÄúBest Heavily Shorted Stocks To Buy Right Now‚Äù from Nasdaq.com üìà\n\njust look at the stats: \n\nAMC üéû\n\nShares Outstanding: 287.28M\n% Held By Insiders: 2.30%\n% Held by Institutions: 37.24% \nShares Short: 44.67M\nShort % of Float: 38.12%\nShort % of Shares Outstanding: 20.67%\n\nGME üéÆ\n\nShares Outstanding: 69.75M\n% Held By Insiders: 27.33%\n% Held by Institutions: 122.04%\nShares Short: 61.78M \nShort % of Float: 226.42%\nShort % of Shares Outstanding: 88.58%\n\nBBBY üß¥\n\nShares Outstanding: 121.22M\n% Held By Insiders: 5.76%\n% Held by Institutions: 117.88%\nShares Short: 74.89M\nShort % of Float: 82.41%\nShort % of Shares Outstanding: 61.78%\n\nSPCE üöÄ\n\nShares Outstanding: 234.34M\n% Held By Insiders: 40%\n% Held by Institutions: 29.72%\nShares Short: 38.6M \nShort % of Float: 56.15%\nShort % of Shares Outstanding: 16.47%\n\nFUBO üì∫\n\nShares Outstanding: 108.85M\n% Held By Insiders: 17.38%\n% Held by Institutions: 7.24%\nShares Short: 39.17M\nShort % of Float: 72.74%\nShort % of Shares Outstanding: 57.98%\n\nAs you can see Gamestop (GME) has the least amount of shares outstanding (by far) of any of these stocks, yet has the second most number of shares shorted behind BBBY which has almost DOUBLE the amount of shares outstanding. \n\nSo, \nAMC has 15.5% of it‚Äôs total shares shorted\nBBBY has 61.7% of its total shares shorted\nFUBO has 35.98% of its total shares shorted\nSPCE has 16.47% of its total shares shorted\n\nBut GME has 88.57% of it‚Äôs shares shorted!?!?!?!?\n\nLook, I am not a financial advisor and none of this is financial advice, and I may be just a retard, but this retard thinks that everything going on with Gamestop is not just unsusal but downright strange. \n\nIs there any explanation that someone can give me that explains why GME is being shorted SO MUCH, and why it‚Äôs stats are like that? üôåüèªüíé</td>

If each retard accumulates 18 shares.... we would own 200% of the whole company. And nobody says you can't have more than 18 shares.\n\nThen we all support Ryan and his team to build GME into a trillion dollar company. GME could grow into an online giant in gaming, finance, news, online brokerage...... The company would have 8 million loyal customers on day one!\n\n**üíéüôå**</td>

      <td>I opened a Vanguard account two or three days ago to skrrr on Robinghood. I asked my wife's bf for some money, made a deposit, and started the verification process. Today, Vanguard finished verifying my account via the "what amounts did we deposit into your account" method. I went to bet my entire account balance on GME, and it wouldn't let me, because of "insufficient funds". I tried buying BBBY instead, because my wife's bf likes their lotion, and same thing.\n\nI called their customer service and held for TWO HOURS just for them to tell me, "new rules cause of mArKeT vOlAtIlItY. All you can buy for the first seven days after your deposit is Vanguard ETF's and and Vanguard mutual funds". The reason they gave was that they need to wait for the money to clear the entire banking system. \n\nI guess next I'm trying Fidelity but doubt I'll be able to get in before the squeeze, especially since Vanguard is holding my lunch money hostage. Wife's bf is gonna be pissed.\n\nTLDR: read the title. Try Fidelity. Hold the fucking line.</td>

I totally fell for the FUD as my beloved rocket stonk continues to swan dive into my wife's boyfriends bunghole.\n\nSo onto why the pheasant's FUD ended up only causing an hours long instead of perma brain damage.  BECAUSE HE IS A SMOOTH MOUTH BREATHER:\n\n1. Fact one: Buying has been greater than selling. Buying has been greater than selling. Everyone knows that if we buy and hold, a payday will come at some point thanks to the hedgies continuing to double down on GME shorts.\n2. Fact two: multiple stonks have mirrored movement.  See AMC for an example.\n3. Fact three: Volume is too fucking low.  Volume was only 77mil today looking at RH.\n4. Fact four: the hedgies aren't closing their positions, see #3.  There are no more shares available to short.\n5. Fact five: I haven't gone FULL retard.  Never go FULL retard.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy personal opinion is that we are never going to be able to build up enough momentum alone to turn this thing around.  But we don't have to.  We do not need momentum anymore, we just need to maintain scarcity of the shorted stocks.  Literally, just need to hold until the hedgies starts to close their positions, hold for as long as possible, then its all over.\n\nThis isn't a bubble, this isn't some overblown hype train, this is just the way of these meme stonks.  \n\nThis isn't a get rich quick scheme, this is buying tickets to the squeeze show.  Tickets just went on discount.  Anyone bailing is a smoothed brained pheasant.  Fuck you, fight me in the Wendy's. I am an alpha ape with a big pp. \*spams emojis\*</td>

This means they help fill advertising space, primarily on websites, apps, and **connected TV (CTV)** platforms. Price per share at time of writing: $40.20\n\n**CTV -** Basically anything that is not cable TV is connected TV. Connecting through your xbox or roku or apple TV or however you want to stream TV. This is the **primary source of revenue** for $MGNI. Are you on the poor people version of Hulu that runs ads? Those ads run through MGNI.\n\nSo let me ask you - is there a movement towards cable TV, or a movement towards finding other ways to watch TV through streaming services? I think you know the answer. And that is reason #1 to buy in. **As CTV increases in popularity, so does demand for advertising space, and so does $MGNI revenue.**\n\n**Industry comparison -**\n\nTrade Desk ($TTD). TTD operates on the buy side of ad tech, so while not exactly the same, they are within the same industry. TTD is currently **up 2800%** over the last 4 years, with a market cap of $38.5 billion. Where is $MGNI? A shade under $5 billion. Now is it realistic to expect MGNI to be the next home run play like TTD (who my brother sold for $50/share, RIP)? Predicting anything to go up 2800% in 4 years is unlikely but who knows. But **if MGNI can get to even half the market cap of TTD, that is a price target of $160.** (Current: $40/share, Mcap 4.75 Billion)\n\n**Past/future earnings:**\n\nPast earnings and future earnings show the story of a company with fairly rapid growth. Take a look for yourself:\n\nQ1 2020 Revenue - $36.3MM, up 12% YoY from Q1 2019\n\nQ2 2020 Revenue - $42.3MM, up 12% YoY from Q2 2019\n\nQ3 2020 Revenue - $61MM, up 62% YoY from Q3 2019\n\n*Q4 2020 Revenue - Expected $72-75MM, up \~50% YoY from Q4 2019*\n\n**$MGNI is up %335 in the past 12 mo, am I too late to the party?**\n\nAnswer: **NO,** and although I already outlined some reasons why above, here is a list for you:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. CTV will      only increase in popularity, which is where the bulk of MGNI revenue comes      from\n2. $MGNI is      showing accelerated growth, great for a mid-cap company to try to make the      jump to large-cap\n3. Trade Desk      (TTD), who is not a competitor but is in the same industry, is valued      nearly 10x higher than MGNI.\n4. Earnings      coming up 2/24, which I expect MGNI to crush, and I do not think that      earnings are priced in yet.\n5. Needham      analyst Laura Martin makes MGNI her top pick for 2021, saying 500% growth      is possible (Jan 13 [Why Wall Street analysts think Magnite may be the      next hot play in ad tech (cnbc.com)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/13/why-wall-street-analysts-think-magnite-may-be-the-next-hot-play-in-ad-tech.html))\n6. Survived a      short hit piece by Spruce Point Capital on Jan 8 (Thank you for a low      entry point for some calls)\n7. **PR Today: Launch of ‚ÄúUnified Decisioning‚Äù,** a new MGNI product/software. From article:\n\n*‚ÄúPublishers are eager to tap into the efficiencies that programmatic provides without relinquishing the control they are used to when selling directly to buyers. Unified Decisioning enables them to do both and we‚Äôre excited to bring these capabilities to leading CTV publishers.‚Äù* Link: [*Magnite Introduces Open Beta of New CTV &amp; OTT Solution Named Unified Decisioning | Business Wire*](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210202005138/en/Magnite-Introduces-Open-Beta-of-New-CTV-OTT-Solution-Named-Unified-Decisioning)\n\nIf you‚Äôre interested in companies that are trending from bottom-left to top-right, then I encourage you to invest in $MGNI. I believe it is a **good short-term play**; having just went on a weeklong dip from Jan 22 - Jan 29, I think you have a decent entry point here at $41.50, although I believe any entry point is fine at this stage in the company‚Äôs growth. Also in the short-term is earnings on 2/24 which I believe will be good for MGNI. It is also a **good long-term play** for reasons above, my EOY price target is $125, although it would not surprise me if it goes significantly higher. The $MGNI train hasn‚Äôt even left the station!\n\nPositions: 100 shares @ $16, 2/19 35c x5, 2/19 40c x2, 2/19 45c x10, 2/19 50c x2 (Slight degeneracy)\n\n**TL/DR:** MGNI is a growing company in the growing industry of advertising in (primarily) connected TV services (Think: Roku). Same realm as $TTD but 1/10th the market cap. Much room to grow. Earnings coming up 2/24 and Laura Martin‚Äôs stock pick of 2021. Just released beta of new software today. Not financial advice, I just like the stock.</td>

      <td>Hello brothers. It has been quite the start of the week. The shorts have not won the battle of GameStop or AMC. \n\nWhile these battles rage on there are many more. While I fully support the GME &amp; AMC run I noticed the new steam brewing about a silver squeeze. \n\nThe idea of a silver squeeze was quickly turned down and here at WSB due to Citadel owning many calls on SLV and other tickers. \n\nBut we must notice the bigger picture here, JP Morgan is a huge player in the manipulation of these commodities and they should be held accountable.\n\nThey are just as bad as citadel, we must remember the message behind the run ups on GME AMC and more. This same message might actually apply to silver. I think it might actually be worth looking into brothers, this is a potentially good choice, that‚Äôs all I‚Äôm asking is for you to double check the situation of silver.\n\nApe together strong, long GME AMC.\n\nEdit: remember the message boys, the reason behind the trades, let us learn and expand our expertise on these specific set of requirements and logistics in the future. Stay true to the message and meaning.</td>

      <td>First, I am still holding. 145 shares GME, 111 shares AMC. Not shilling.\n\n\nThere are so many people on here just flooding with "HOLD HOLD!" "üíéüíéüíéüñêüñêüñêüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüåëüåëüåë" and such...   People calling others paper handed and what not and putting them down for worrying and even selling because they were scared.\n\n\nWe are all humans here. Everyone has a different level of stress tolerance.  \n\n\nJust sitting around saying HOLD HOLDüíéüíéüñêüñêüöÄüöÄüåëüåëüåë isn't making anyone feel better or more optimistic after the last two days... and honestly, it is not contributing shit to this subreddit either.\n\n\nBasing whether we hold on what DFV is doing is nonsense at this point.  Don't get me wrong, I'm cheering him on all the way to the bank... but the guy already cashed out $14mil!!! Even if GME went to $0, he would still have $14mil he made. Even after taxes, the guy never has to work again if he just throws his gains into some index funds or something.  Of course he isn't going to sell. It isn't going to negatively affect him at all.  Why is that the reason others are holding? It makes no sense.\n\n\n\nIt is ok for people to be scared. It is ok for people to sell if they need to. It is ok for people to still be holding but still scared and asking questions and wondering what is going on. These last two days have been very tough for me, personally... so I imagine they've been even tougher for most of the people on this subreddit.  We need to acknowledge this amidst the flood of nonsense memes.  There used to be so much more on this subreddit as far as real, actual, data-driven information and opinions.  We need more of that and less memes.\n\n\nWe also need to just be more accepting of people being freaked out right now. It is NORMAL.  \n\n\nI have no idea where this will go. I bought in at $42.09 so I am still ok now but you want to know the truth? I'm not in this to "stick it to the man". That is just a nice side-benefit. I wanted to make some cash. Pay off student loans. That kind of thing.  I think most people here are also here trying to make some money.  We need to quit acting like we are all here to just go after Wall St.  That is a great thing and it needs to happen, obviously... but we need to be realistic.  As the stock drops, many people on here may HAVE to sell to make sure they don't lose their initial investment and that is totally fine because we do not need to encourage people to lose their initial investment just to get back at Wall St.  Remember, we are the everyday people here. We have day jobs.   We are allowed to be afraid and allowed to sell if we need to.  I am not saying I will be selling, but just people here as a whole.</td>

      <td>https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shortinterestratio.asp\n\nLimitations of the Short Interest Ratio\n\n"The short interest ratio has several flaws, the first being that is not updated regularly. Short interest is reported every two weeks and is usually as of the 15th and the last day of the month. It takes several days before the information is published and by that time, the number of shares short in the market may have already changed."\n\nShort likely were covering as the price increased. Now I agree that GME was manipulated and if it were not it likely could have run to 1K while other stocks may have run up higher too like AMC. However I really hope everyone understands that GME likely never sees those highs again. Furthermore this spamming of "Hold" is probably making the majority of WSB lose money.\n\nAll in all the squeeze was right and the manipulation did happen but the top was last week and it's not coming back.</td>
